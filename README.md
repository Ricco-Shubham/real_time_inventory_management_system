📦 Real-Time Inventory Management System

This project is a Python-based real-time inventory management system designed to help shop owners efficiently track and manage stock, customer orders, and sales records. It uses Supabase (PostgreSQL in the cloud) as the backend database, and integrates OOP principles, database transactions, and secure password handling to ensure reliability and scalability.

🛒 Order Processing – Handle customer purchases with support for multiple products per order

🔄 Transaction Pooling – Ensures safe and efficient database operations with psycopg2

🔐 Security – Passwords are hashed before storing in the database

📈 Analytics Ready – Inventory and sales data can be visualized for insights into buying behavior

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python (OOP, threading optional)

Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
